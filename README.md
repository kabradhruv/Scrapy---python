# Scrapy---python


Hey guys , This is a scrapy repository where I have put my scrappers . I have provided my crawler programs only in this repository so just add them in your spider folder after running startproject command.

If you don't know then these are the steps -
1. Donwload python and scrapy library
2. Go to a folder and start terminal there 
3. Type scrapy startproject {projectName}
4. Now , type in terminal cd {projectName}
5. Leave the terminal there and now go to {projectName} -> {projectName} -> spider
6. Copy my scrapper to spider folder where you will only find __init__.py
7. Now again go to the shell and use commands given in the programs to get the the output file as json,xml,csv
8. Remember that programs which I wrote needs some changes in items.py which are given in the program only
9. Thankyou
